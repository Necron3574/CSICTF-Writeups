# Flying Places
This was another ~~FUN~~ Osint challenge.  
We were given a picture of what looked like a plane and some kind of cargo.  
The question asks us to find out where a particular reporter lives who was reporting there lives.
I ran a Google image find and I got to know that this image was in a tweet from Chinese tycoon Jack Ma.  
And then I spent about 1 and a half hour stalking him on twitter to no avail.  
Finally I realised that I completely missed the comment section of his tweet.  
I scrolled thorugh it and found a tweet by a man named `Sergio Quintana` which said:  
```Where are these supplies headed in the US?
I’m a reporter in San Francisco.
If they’re headed here, I’d love to see the flights land if possible.```
It all finally made sense when I saw this comment.  
Hence he was the reporter and he lived in San Francisco.
