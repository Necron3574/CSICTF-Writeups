# No DIStractions
This is a typical discord bot challenge.  
The question tells us that the bot won't give us the flag unless its commanded to do so.  
So on dming the bot with `.list` gives us a list of commands (The flag command is obviously missing).  
Now we know we can initiate a command with a dot.  
Hence I tried `.flag` and voila I got the flag.
